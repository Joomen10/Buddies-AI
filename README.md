# Buddies_AI

Buddies AI offers a Streamlit and OpenAI-based interactive chatbot, designed primarily for the elderly to easily engage with digital content. This chatbot specializes in processing PDF documents, enabling users to query and discuss their contents. It features a voice-reading capability using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for auditory responses. Originating from a Hackathon project themed around Companionship, its goal is to connect the elderly with the digital world, simplifying the challenge of reading lengthy texts in PDFs and understanding chatbot responses.
